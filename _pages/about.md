------
I am a PhD student of Computational Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita"](https://www.math.unipd.it/) of the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/) under the supervision of Prof. [Francesco Rinaldi](https://www.math.unipd.it/~rinaldi/) (University of Padua). <br/>

My interested are centered around continuous optimization methods for large scale problems, including first order, projection-free, and derivative free methods. <br/>

I received my Master's degree in Mathematics in 2019 at the University of Padua with a thesis on the convergence properties of some Frank-Wolfe variants, under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Rinaldi.<br/>
